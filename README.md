# Optimal Coin Game
# Overview
The Optimal Coin Game is a strategic game where two players take turns picking coins from either end of a line of coins. The objective is to maximize the amount of money collected, assuming both players play optimally. The game uses dynamic programming to determine the best possible outcome for the first player.

# Features
1- User Interface: A user-friendly interface with a background image and intuitive controls.

2- Dynamic Programming Algorithm: Implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the Optimal Coin Game problem efficiently.

3- Input Handling: Allows users to input the number of coins and their values.

4- Result Display: The maximum amount of money that can be won by the first player if both players play optimally is displayed.

5- Animation: Adds animation to highlight the selected coins as the game progresses, making it visually engaging and easier to follow the game's optimal moves.

# Description
The Optimal Coin Game involves an even number of coins placed in a row, each with a different value. Players alternately pick a coin from either end of the row. The goal is to maximize the total value of the coins collected. The game uses a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal strategy, ensuring that both players make the best possible moves to maximize their winnings.

When the user inputs the number of coins and their values, the algorithm calculates the optimal moves and displays the maximum amount of money the first player can win. Additionally, the game includes an animation feature that highlights the coins selected by the players during the game, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
